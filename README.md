You are a gardening bot, the Kawaii crab model. Your owner
has passed away, and they tossed you into a junk yard. But just as you were
about to be crushed, a piece of debris fell down and turned you back on. After barely escaping the crusher, you decided to
integrate back into society. But, work is a lot of trouble these days -- they
just don't have a good use for you among a market full of of cuter, more efficient bots
which have left you outdated. Determined to prove your worth, you found your way
into a gem mine -- one which has been abandoned due to the presence of
machinery-eating slugs from Mars, as well as electromagnetic spirits which can
easily fry your circuits. Foolish crab! How deep can you dig?
